Progressing Through Programming: A Journey of Continuous Learning and Application

As a Master of Computer Science (MCS) student, I, Yeshi Leksang, am on a path of continuous improvement in my programming skills. Every day, I strive to expand my understanding and hands-on experience across various domains of technology.

Focusing on Core Programming Skills
Programming is not just about writing code, but about developing problem-solving abilities. I focus on learning and improving through consistent practice in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). DSA is fundamental to efficient coding, and I constantly practice solving complex problems that enhance my understanding of time complexity and space optimization.

Building Web and Application Development Skills
In addition to strengthening my algorithmic thinking, I have immersed myself in web development and application development. I work on both frontend and backend technologies to create interactive and dynamic web applications. Over time, I have developed several apps and websites, experimenting with various frameworks like Flask, React, and Node.js. I focus on creating intuitive user interfaces, strong backend architectures, and seamless user experiences.

Exploring Operating Systems Across All Platforms
My curiosity also extends to understanding how operating systems (OS) work. I have begun studying Windows, macOS, and Linux in depth, learning the differences and similarities between them. Understanding the kernel, file systems, memory management, and process handling across these systems has been a fascinating part of my learning journey. This knowledge is crucial for optimizing software and ensuring compatibility across different environments.

Error Identification and Debugging
An essential aspect of my learning is error identification and debugging. I constantly work on finding bugs, testing my applications, and improving the performance of my code. This process has taught me to be meticulous, patient, and persistent in solving problems.

A Continual Process of Learning
This journey is ongoing, and I believe that the process of learning should never stop. By tackling new challenges, solving problems, and building applications, I am developing a diverse skill set that spans multiple fields in computer science. Every week, I upgrade my skills and knowledge, applying them to new projects and real-world scenarios.

Through this process, I am not only honing my technical skills but also developing a mindset for continuous growth and adaptability, which will serve me well in the ever-evolving tech industry.
